# 📊🧬 Exploratory Data Analysis on Habermans Cancer Survival Dataset 📈🔬

📋 Project Overview:
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Haberman's Cancer Survival dataset, which was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains data from a study conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. It has 306 instances and 4 attributes, including the class attribute.

🎯 Objective:
The primary objective of this analysis is to determine whether a patient is likely to survive for more than 5 years based on their age, year of operation, and the number of positive axillary nodes detected. Our focus will be on studying the correlations between the different features and the output variable.

🔍 Analysis:
The analysis is divided into two parts:
1. Univariate Analysis: We will plot Probability Density Function (PDF), Cumulative Density Function (CDF), Boxplot, and Voilin plots to explore each feature individually.
2. Bivariate Analysis: We will plot 2D Scatter plots and Pair plots to explore the relationships between different features.

📈 Conclusion:
After analyzing the dataset, we conclude that the number of positive axillary nodes detected is the most important feature in determining the survival status of patients. Patients with fewer positive axillary nodes have a higher chance of survival. Additionally, patients who underwent surgery in the early years had a lower chance of survival. The age of the patient at the time of operation was not a significant factor in determining the survival status.
